**The phenomena which are prohibited at various levels are:**

**dirty read** A transaction reads data written by a concurrent uncommitted transaction.

**nonrepeatable read** A transaction re-reads data it has previously read and finds that data has been modified by another transaction (that committed since the initial read).

**phantom read** A transaction re-executes a query returning a set of rows that satisfy a search condition and finds that the set of rows satisfying the condition has changed due to another recently-committed transaction.

**serialization anomaly** The result of successfully committing a group of transactions is inconsistent with all possible orderings of running those transactions one at a time.

|Isolation Level	|Dirty Read	|Nonrepeatable Read	|Phantom Read	|Serialization Anomaly|
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
|Read uncommitted	|Allowed, but not in PG	|Possible	|Possible	|Possible|
|Read committed	|Not possible	|Possible	|Possible	|Possible|
|Repeatable read	|Not possible	|Not possible	|Allowed, but not in PG	|Possible|
|Serializable	|Not possible	|Not possible	|Not possible	|Not possible|

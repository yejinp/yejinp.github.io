Don’t Be Afraid To Explore Beneath The Surface


Professor Aronnax risked his life and career to find the elusive Nautilus and to join Captain Nemo on a long series of amazing underwater adventures. We should do the same: Don’t be afraid to dive underwater – inside and underneath the tools, languages and technologies that you use every day. You may know all about how to use Postgres, but do you really know how Postgres itself works internally? Take a look inside; before you know it, you’ll be on an underwater adventure of your own.

Studying the Computer Science at work behind the scenes of our applications isn’t just a matter of having fun, it’s part of being a good developer. As software development tools improve year after year, and as building web sites and mobile apps becomes easier and easier, we shouldn’t loose sight of the Computer Science we depend on. We’re all standing on the shoulders of giants – people like Lehman and Yao, and the open source developers who used their theories to build Postgres. Don’t take the tools you use everyday for granted – take a look inside them! You’ll become a wiser developer and you’ll find insights and knowledge you could never have imagined before.
